      <title>Password Migration</title>

      <description>One of the core principles underlying libpasta is that it should be easy to use best practice password hashing algorithms. Unfortunately, many people are currently not using these algorithms, and furthermore, &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo; seems to be very hard to pin down. To solve this, we include support for painless migration, which can even be enabled automatically.
Migrating a password hash is a subtle problem. The whole point of password storage is that you cannot recover the password.</description>

      <title>Tuning &amp; Parameter Selection</title>

      <description>libpasta comes with a set of secure default algorithm and parameter choices. However, there is no single set of parameters which is suitable for all purposes and we provide tools to help with parameter selection.
These tools also have the benefit of working as a benchmarking platform for the target system; if the system performs significantly worse than the expected times, this could result in suboptimal, or even insecure, parameters selected.</description>
