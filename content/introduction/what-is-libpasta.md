#### _Making Passwords Painless_

This library aims to be a all-in-one solution for password storage. In
particular, we aim to provide:

 - Easy-to-use password storage with sane defaults.
 - Tools to provide parameter tuning for different use cases.
 - Automatic migration of password to new algorithms.
 - Cross-platform builds and cross-language bindings.
